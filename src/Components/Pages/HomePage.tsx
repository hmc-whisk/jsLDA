                            <p>
                                When you first load a dataset, your topics will be more or less useless. You can fix
                                this by having the model run iterations over your documents. Everything you need to do
                                this can be found at the top left of the page. 100 to 200 iterations is good for initial
                                investigation. For a final model and more reliable topics, you may want to do thousands
                                of iterations.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Choosing the best number of topics to include in your model can be a tricky decision.
                                Including too many topics can create duplicate topics, or create topics which are too
                                specific to be useful. Include too few and your topics will miss more subtle, but
                                potentially very important, themes. There is no straight forward answer to how many
                                topics any model should have. Instead, trying a few different numbers and seeing which
                                one works best tends to be a pretty good method. Alternatively, there are tools out
                                there that will choose an optimal number of topics based on a few different metrics, but
                                no such tool is included here.

                                Stopwords can be edited by uploading a stoplist or using the vocabulary tab.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A stopword is any word you would like to exclude from your model. During training and
                                analysis your model will skip over stopwords, pretending like they do not exist. By
                                default, some basic words like "the" are already included in your stoplist. Stopwords
                                should be added sparingly, as adding too many can remove valuable information from your
                                model.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One good indicator of how much information you might lose from adding a stopword
                                is that word's topic specificity. Words with a high specificity (closer to 1) are more
                                specific to a small number of topics and tend to tell you more about the contents of
                                those topics. Words with a low specificity are found more commonly in many topics, and
                                therefore don't tell you as much about any individual topic. Another important
                                consideration is whether or not a word is relevant to what you are trying to analyze
                                with your topic model. For example, if gender is important to your analysis, you'll want
                                to keep pronouns in the model. If you are not looking at gender, you can consider adding
                                pronouns to your list of stopwords.

                                can give you an initial idea of the theme that topic is latching on to. If the most
                                common words are unhelpful because they are the same for every topic, you may consider
                                adding those common words to your list of stopwords.

                                The meaning of words in isolation can be hard to discern, so it is necessary to look at
                                them in context before making any conclusions about a topic. The topic document tab is
                                how jsLDA 2.0 enables you to do this. To start, you’ll want to click on the topic you’d
                                like to investigate in the topic bar. Now the documents will be sorted by their topic
                                score. This score mostly indicates how much of the topic appears in this document, but
                                it is also weighted to favor longer documents.
                            </p>
                            <p> Once you’ve done this, you can click on documents to reveal their full text.
                                When the document is extended, you will notice that some words are highlighted. This highlighting is based on a metric called saliency.
                                First theorized by Chuang et al and later adapted for looking at words in the context of
                                topics by Alexander et al, this metric represents both how much of the topic that word
                                accounts for and how distinct the word is to that topic. Words with a high saliency
                                score are relatively common in the given topic and appear more in the selected topic
                                than other topics. The 'Use Saliency' option allows you to sort the documents by their
                                average saliency score.

                                Here you can investigate how topics relate to each other. Displayed on this page is a
                                large grid of blue and red circles. Each circle represents whether two topics occur in
                                the same documents more or less often than they would at random. This is calculated by
                                two topic’s pointwise mutual information scores. Blue circles mean they occur together
                                more than we would expect, and red means they occur together less than we would expect.
                                The size of the circle indicates the magnitude of their correlation. Hovering over a
                                circle will provide additional information.

                                assigned to that topic at that time. While a topic is selected, only the graph for that
                                topic will appear. Hovering over this plot will give you more information.

                                graphs available for use. For discrete data, you may use each of the bar plots. The
                                normal bar plots are best for getting information about a particular topic, while the
                                topic bar plot is best at getting information about which topics are related to a
                                specific metadata value. For continuous data, the scatter plot is available. If you

                        models. You can begin by choosing a default dataset to
                        work with, or by uploading your own dataset. If you are
                        unfamiliar with topic models, reading <a

                        a good place to start. For a more technical explanation

                        <p>
                            If you choose to upload your own dataset, your files must
                            be formatted so that jsLDA 2.0 can interpret them.

                    <h3>Training a Model</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your topics will start out totally random. To get meaningful topics,
			                 you can have the model run iterations of inference.
                            Most of the controls for this can be found at the very top of the page.

                        <p>Once you've trained a model, you'll need to figure out what your model has found. jsLDA 2.0 has a few different tools to help you do this.</p>

			        <p>
                        jsLDA was originally created by David Mimno at Cornell University. Further development was conducted at Harvey Mudd College by Alfredo Gomez, Dana Harris, Ingrid Wu, Mia Wang, Simon Babb, Taeyun Lee, Tatsuki Kuze, Theo Bayard de Volo, and Xanda Schofield.
