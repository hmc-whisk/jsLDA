This module handles storing arbitrarily large data into the browser's storage.
Per Origin Eviction policy
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Browser_storage_limits_and_eviction_criteria),
the maximum amount of data the browser can store for this project is 10% of the
free-disk space, up to 2GB, which should be more than enough in most cases.
While all data interfaces referred to within this project are called storage,
the data actually go into IndexedDB. This is because LocalStorage cannot handle
binary data, but calling the object database would be too confusing for anyone
who doesn't care about implementation details as the only purpose of it is to
store some binary (deflated text) data.

Saves the given data to the browser storage, associated with a given key. The

storage later. If the data is a string, it is saved to the storage as-is. If it
is an object, it will be passed into JSON.stringify() first, which implies that
not all objects can be perfectly reconstructed from the storage, so some caution
is required before passing arbitrary objects into this function.
